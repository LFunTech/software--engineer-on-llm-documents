# Change: Add OpenSpec + AI planning guide

## Why
Engineers need a repeatable way to use AI tools to create and refine OpenSpec proposals, designs, and deltas without violating formatting rules.

## What Changes
- Add a planning guide that shows how to scaffold OpenSpec changes, write deltas, and validate with AI assistance
- Include prompt patterns for proposal drafting, spec delta authoring, ambiguity checks, and validation loops
- Provide a worked example that goes from idea → proposal → spec deltas

## Impact
- Affected specs: vibe-openspec-planning (new capability)
- Affected docs: docs/vc-openspec-planning.md, docs/vibe-coding-tutorial.md
