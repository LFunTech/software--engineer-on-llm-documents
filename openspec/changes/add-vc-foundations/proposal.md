# Change: Add vibe coding foundations tutorial

## Why
New teammates need a step-by-step primer to install, configure, and safely use Codex CLI, Claude Code, Cursor, and similar assistants, so they can start shipping with AI on day one.

## What Changes
- Add a foundations tutorial covering tool overviews, install/setup, sign-in, repo access, and safety practices
- Include first-week exercises and starter prompts for common tasks (navigation, search, small edits)
- Link the foundations doc from the main vibe-coding hub

## Impact
- Affected specs: vibe-coding-foundations (new capability)
- Affected docs: docs/vc-foundations.md, docs/vibe-coding-tutorial.md
