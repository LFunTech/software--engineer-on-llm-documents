# Change: Add implementation cookbook for vibe coding

## Why
Developers need step-by-step, AI-assisted playbooks for frontend and backend delivery that map specs to code with reproducible prompts and command sequences.

## What Changes
- Add an implementation cookbook covering frontend (React/SPA) and backend (API/service) flows with vibe coding tools
- Provide file maps, prompt templates, and minimal code patterns per flow
- Include guidance for integrating generated code with existing style, logging, and error handling

## Impact
- Affected specs: vibe-implementation-cookbook (new capability)
- Affected docs: docs/vc-implementation-cookbook.md, docs/vibe-coding-tutorial.md
