# Change: Add vibe-coding tutorial for OpenSpec-driven delivery

## Why
Team members need a practical guide on using AI coding tools (Codex CLI, Claude Code, Cursor, and similar vibe coding assistants) together with OpenSpec so they can deliver solutions consistently from planning through operations.

## What Changes
- Add a tutorial that introduces core vibe coding tools, setup, and safe usage patterns
- Document how to combine OpenSpec with AI tools for planning, frontend, backend, testing, and operations workflows
- Provide concrete prompts and an end-to-end example to make the process repeatable

## Impact
- Affected specs: vibe-coding-tutorial (new capability)
- Affected code/docs: docs/vibe-coding-tutorial.md
